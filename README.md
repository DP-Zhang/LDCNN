# MatConvNet implementation for low dimensional CNN (LDCNN)
LDCNN is a CNN architecture consisting of common convolutional layers and the mlpconv layer used in Network in Network (NIN). LDCNN 
is proposed in “Learning Low Dimensional Convolutional Neural Networks for High-Resolution Remote Sensing Image Retrieval”.
# How to use
1. Download MatConvNet (1.0-beta23 and 24 are tested) and add it to the root directory. Compile MatConvNet and call root directory LDCNN.
2. Download the AID dataset and add it to the data directory, i.e. LDCNN/data/AID/
3.
